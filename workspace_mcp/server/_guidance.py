USAGE_SUMMARY = (
    "Use snake_case payloads. Start with get_workspace_snapshot to discover valid "
    "dashboard_id, dashboard_composition, and skills from the live Workspace "

    "discovery. Do not invent identifiers."
)
WIDGET_SCHEMA_GUIDANCE = (
    "Use list_available_widgets to enumerate candidates and get_widget_schema to "
    "inspect one exact widget contract before creating it. get_widget_schema "
    "includes grid_data defaults and min/max layout constraints when the widget "
    "definition provides them. If a param returns requires_options_lookup=true, "
    "call get_params_options before create_widget or update_widget and do not "
    "invent values for that param. Always pass the origin returned by "
    "list_available_widgets; blank origin means the catalog is invalid."
)
CREATE_WIDGET_GUIDANCE = (
    "For create_widget, pass origin as the exact catalog value returned by "
    "list_available_widgets. Pass data_args and ui_args as objects when config "
    "values are needed."
)
DATA_SOURCE_SHAPE = (
    "Pass origin, widget_id, and data_args for one data source. "
    "data_args and ssm_request must be objects. "
    "For chart widgets, include raw=true in data_args to fetch the underlying "
    "rows instead of the Plotly figure JSON; the figure is for the renderer, "
    "reasoning needs rows."

PARAM_OPTIONS_SHAPE = (
    "Pass origin, widget_id, param_name, and optional data_args for one "
    "parameter option query. Only call get_params_options after get_widget_schema "
    "shows the exact param has requires_options_lookup=true. Use the exact "
    "paramName from the schema as param_name. data_args must be an object with "
    "the values required by options_lookup_params when present."
)
GENERATIVE_WIDGET_GUIDANCE = (
    "For add_generative_widget: note and html require data as the raw text or "
    "HTML content string. table requires data as an array of objects. chart "
    "requires data as an array of objects plus chart_params as an object with "
    "chartType, xKey, and non-empty yKey (camelCase keys; the frontend rejects "
    "snake_case). "
    "Use widget_type='note' for rich text notes such as rich_note. "
    "The response includes widget_uuid; use that UUID for layout changes. "
    "The inner_tab argument only places the new widget on an existing navigation tab; "
    "it does not create a tab. To put a generated widget on a new tab, first call "
    'manage_navigation_bar operation="add_tabs" with tabs such as [{"name":"AAPL Analysis"}], '
    "then navigate_workspace to the generated slug tab_id such as aapl-analysis, "
    "then call add_generative_widget without inner_tab so it lands on the active tab."

WIDGET_INSTANCE_GUIDANCE = (
    "Prefer widget_uuid for read, update, and delete. widget_id is only a fallback "

NOTE_UPDATE_GUIDANCE = (
    "To change the text of an existing rich_note (note) widget, call update_widget "
    "with the new body in ui_args under the key html, for example "
    'ui_args={"html": "<p>New note text</p>"}. A note body is stored as HTML, so '
    "pass HTML, not markdown or plain text. This edits the note in place and keeps "
    "its widget_uuid and layout. Do not delete and recreate the note to change its "
    "text, and do not put note text in data_args or under a data key — those are "

    "calling get_workspace_snapshot again. Use get_workspace_snapshot only on "
    "the first call, or after a navigation step that may have invalidated the "
    "tracked context. Never match dashboards by name: duplicates with identical "
    "names are common. \"This dashboard\" means the current route; resolve via "
    "current_dashboard_uuid, not title. Omitting dashboard_id also targets the "
    "current route, but do not send placeholder strings such as active_dashboard, "
    "current_dashboard, null, or undefined."

CREATE_DASHBOARD_GUIDANCE = (

    "The grid is 40 columns wide: full width is w=40, half width is w=20, one quarter "
    "is w=10. Typical minimums are about min_w=8 and min_h=4. If a navigation_bar is "
    "present it usually occupies y=0 with h=2, so the first content row usually starts "
    "at y=2."
)
NAVIGATION_BAR_GUIDANCE = (
    "manage_navigation_bar manages the navigation_bar widget inside an existing dashboard. "
    "If the dashboard does not already have a navigation_bar widget, call create first. "
    "Its create operation creates or initializes navigation tabs on that dashboard; it does not create a dashboard. "
    "For create, add_tabs, and remove_tabs, tabs must be an array of objects, "
    'for example [{"name":"AAPL Analysis"}]. Each object must use only the key name, not tab_id or tab_name. '

APP_BUILDER_DOCS_GUIDANCE = (
    "For custom Workspace backend/app authoring, review, debugging, or "

    "and ui_args_json. list_available_widgets only returns the deterministic plain-create "
    "subset; widgets that still need runtime-only bootstrap are intentionally "
    "excluded. Do not use create_widget for rich_note; use add_generative_widget "
    "with widget_type='note'. Use manage_dashboard operation='read' or "
    "get_workspace_snapshot.dashboard_composition "
    "to inspect visible layout and update_widget_layout to move or resize "
    "widgets. When asked to put content on a new tab, create the tab first with "
    "manage_navigation_bar add_tabs using tabs_json objects with only name, then "
    "navigate_workspace to the generated slug tab_id, then create the widget without "
